### 10a Solution
Assuming your command line starts in the `react-course` folder:
1. `cd chatbot-project`
2. `npm run build`
3. Drag the `dist` folder into the `ecommerce-backend` folder.
4. `cd ../ecommerce-backend`
5. `npm run zip`. This will create `ecommerce-backend-*.zip` (* = version number).
6. Upload this zip file to Elastic Beanstalk.
7. Open your website, it should now show the Chatbot project.
