1. In `ecommerce-project` run `npm run build`.
2. Due to the config in `vite.config.ts` the `dist` folder should be created in `ecommerce-backend`.
3. Open the `dist` folder and notice the TypeScript code has been converted to normal JavaScript.
4. Since this project has a backend, you cannot use GitHub Pages to put it on the Internet. You'll need to use AWS (like we did in lesson 10).
