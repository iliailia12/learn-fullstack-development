1. In `chatbot-project` run `npm run build`. This will create a `dist` folder.
2. Open the `dist` folder and notice that all the TypeScript code has been converted to normal JavaScript (browsers cannot run TypeScript, only normal JavaScript).
3. This project does not have a backend, so you can either put it on the Internet using GitHub Pages (follow the same steps as lesson 10 exercises) or AWS (move the `dist` folder into `ecommerce-backend` and upload it to Elastic Beanstalk).
